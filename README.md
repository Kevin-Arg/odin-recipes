# odin-recipes

Hi, im Kevin and this is my first project for Odin.

Its not the first i tried though, tried it once and got stuck trying to upload the project to GitHub, couldnt do it, got frustrated and quit.
So, with this one im gonna do my best to avoid that by doing a proper research to the matter and get a good understanding of it.

So, the project in question, is about cooking recipes, a simple cooking recipes page with some HTML.

Hope you like it and might even try one, thanks!
