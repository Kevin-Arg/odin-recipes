    <h1>Puchero</h1>
        <img src="/images/puchero.jpg" alt="finished puchero">
        <p>Puchero is a type of stew originally from Spain, prepared in Yucatán, Mexico, Argentina,[1] Paraguay, Uruguay, Perú, south of Brazil, the Philippines, and Spain, specifically the autonomous communities of Andalusia and the Canary Islands. The Spanish word "puchero" originally meant an earthenware pot, before being extended to mean any vessel, and then the dish cooked in it.</p>

            <li>500g bone marrow, cut into 3-4 centimeters pieces</li>
            <li>6 small potatos, halved</li>
            <li>200g sweet potato, peeled and cut into large chunks</li>

            <li>Parsley to taste</li>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the brisket and short ribs in a large saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 30 minutes. Drain and rinse the meat under cold water to wash away any impurities.</li>
            <li>Return the meat to a large clean saucepan and add 3 litres (101 fl oz/12 cups) water, the onion, carrot and salt. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium–low and simmer for 1½ hours, using a large metal spoon to remove any impurities that rise to the surface.</li>
            <li>Strain the mixture over a large bowl to collect the stock. Clean the pan and place the cooked meat and vegetables back in the pan, along with 1.5 litres (51 fl oz/6 cups) of the stock and the bone marrow. Place the pan over low heat and add the cabbage, potato, sweet potato and chorizo. Increase the heat to high and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium and cook for 45 minutes, until the vegetables are tender.</li>
            <li>Stir through the parsley and serve hot with plenty of freshly ground black pepper and crusty bread.</li>
