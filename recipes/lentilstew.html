    <h1>Argentinian Lentil Stew</h1>
        <img src="/images/lentilstew.jpg" alt="Picture of a finish lentil stew">
    
    <p>Simple and delicious recipe to eat in the winter. An argentinian classic.</p>
    
    <p>A guiso in Argentina always has a base of lentils and it is the perfect winter dish. Argentines tend to add ‘chorizo español’ or ‘chorizo colorado’ (smoked chorizo) to their lentils, as they have a rich, red colour and are full of flavour and spice.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups lentils</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons oil</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion (chopped)</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves (chopped)</li>
            <li>1 large carrot (peeled and cubed)</li>
            <li>1 medium butternut squash (peeled and cubed)</li>
            <li>2 small potatoes (cubed)</li>
            <li>4 cups vegetable stock</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper (diced)</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped sun dried tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
            <li>freshly ground salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
            <li>extra virgin olive oil (for garnish)</li>
            <li>chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>freshly grated parmesan</li>
            <li>1.5kg beef stew meat</li>
            <li>300 grams bacon</li>
            <li>500 grams chorizo sausages</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the lentils well, removing any debris. Place the cleaned lentils in a large pot of warm water. Soak the lentils for at least 12 hours, or overnight. Rinse them again in the morning.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Saute the onions until they turn transparent, approximately 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, stirring with a wooden spoon to make sure that the garlic doesn’t burn. </li>
            <li>If preparing a carnivore version, add the beef and chorizo to a separate pan and brown. Chop the bacon into 1 inch pieces.</li>
            <li>Add the lentils, carrots, butternut squash, and potatoes. Cook for a few minutes until al dente. </li>
            <li>Pour in the vegetable stock and reduce heat to low. For the meat-eaters version, add the browned beef, chorizo, and bacon. Simmer for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally. </li>
            <li>Add the bell peppers, mushrooms, and sun-dried tomatoes. Cook for another 10 minutes until the lentils are soft, and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Add the tomato paste and smoked paprika. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Divide the stew between four bowls, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, and garnish with parsley.</li>
        </ol>
